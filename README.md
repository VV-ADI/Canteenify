# Canteenify
The idea of this project is to solve the issues faced by students from night canteens and mess,
we are able to preorder the food items using a token system and a token generator as it decreases a lot of waiting time and crowd compared to the traditional method.
it also shows the live timings of the canteens and the food items that are available.
Tokens generated digitally will ensure a first-come, first-served system, reducing crowding and confusion.
